/**
 * Defines the JDK-specific HTTP server API.
 * <p>
 * A basic high-level API for building embedded servers. Both HTTP and
 * HTTPS are supported.
 * <p>
 * The main components are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange} class that describes a
 * request and response pair,</li>
 * <li>the {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler} interface to handle
 * incoming requests,</li>
 * <li>the {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpContext} class that maps a URI path
 * to a {@code HttpHandler},</li>
 * <li>the {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer} class to listen for
 * connections and dispatch requests to handlers,</li>
 * <li>the {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.Filter} class that allows pre- and post-
 * processing of requests.</li></ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.SimpleFileServer} class offers a simple
 * out-of-the-box HTTP file server for educational purposes. A default
 * implementation is provided via the main entry point of this module, which can
 * be used on the command line as such:
 * <p>
 * {@code java -m jdk.httpserver [-p port] [-d directory] [-o none|default|verbose]}
 *
 * @uses com.sun.net.httpserver.spi.HttpServerProvider
 *
 * @moduleGraph
 * @since 9
