/**
 * A handler which is invoked to process HTTP exchanges. Each
 * HTTP exchange is handled by one of these handlers.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * The methods {@link #handleOrElse(Predicate, HttpHandler)} and
 * {@link #adaptRequest(UnaryOperator)} are conveniences to complement and adapt
 * a given handler, in order to extend or modify its functionality.
 * <p>
 * Example of a complemented and adapted {@code HttpHandler}:
 * <pre>    {@code var handler = new SomeHandler().handleOrElse(r -> r.getRequestMethod().equals("PUT"), new SomePutHandler())
 *                                   .adaptRequest(r -> r.with("Foo", List.of("Bar")));
 *    var server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8080), 10, "/", handler);
 *    server.start();
 * }</pre>
 * The above handler adds a custom request header "Foo" to all incoming requests
 * before they are handled. It then delegates the handling of the exchange to
 * the {@code SomePutHandler} instance if the request method is {@code PUT},
 * otherwise it delegates the exchange to the {@code SomeHandler} instance.
 * <p>
 * Example of a nested complemented {@code HttpHandler}:
 * <pre>    {@code var handler = new SomeHandler().handleOrElse(r -> r.getRequestMethod().equals("GET"), new SomeGetHandler())
 *                                   .handleOrElse(r -> r.getRequestHeaders().containsKey("Want-Digest")
 *                                                   && r.getRequestMethod().equals("GET"), new SomeDigestHandler());
 * }</pre>
 * In the case of nested complemented handlers, delegation of the exchange
 * starts at the last method call. The handler delegates the exchange to the
 * {@code SomeDigestHandler} instance if the request header "Want-Digest" is
 * present and the request method is {@code GET}. Otherwise, delegation moves to
 * the second last method call, where the exchange is delegated to the
 * {@code SomeGetHandler} instance if the request method is {@code GET}. All
 * remaining exchanges that don't match either of the request tests are handled
 * by the initial {@code SomeHandler} instance.
 *
